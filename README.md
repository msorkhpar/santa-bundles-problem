Santa and presents bundle picking problem.
Some presents have a value of p1, others have a value of p2, and the remainder have a value of p3. The p values are standardized to be less than one.
Santa wants to distribute these presents among M children in such a manner that each child receives a set of presents worth at least 1.
Santa must carefully select the number of each sort of item to deliver to each child.If Santa distributes the gifts to too many or too few children, each child may not receive enough items.
Help Santa to find the maximum number of kids he should give a visit to so that he could make them satisfied.
